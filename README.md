# Noise-Reduction-in-Audio-Communication
This repository presents a real-time audio denoising system developed in MATLAB, aimed at enhancing the intelligibility of speech signals degraded by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). The project simulates a digital communication environment using BPSK modulation and demodulation, followed by a multi-stage noise reduction pipeline. The system integrates adaptive noise suppression through the Normalized Least Mean Squares (NLMS) algorithm, spectral enhancement using Wiener filtering, and further refinement via spectral subtraction techniques. A custom-built GUI enables real-time visualization of waveforms, frequency spectra, and quantitative performance metrics such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). Designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, the system supports both offline and live audio processing, making it applicable for research in speech enhancement, telecommunication systems, and assistive hearing technologies
